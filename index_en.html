      <p>
        In my constant quest to improve my web development skills, I've recently embarked on a new adventure: the
        learning path at <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. This platform
        offers practical challenges that will allow me to expand my knowledge in HTML and CSS, as well as introduce me
        to the world of JavaScript, a language that has been unknown to me until now.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to complement this learning with my current projects. I believe that keeping myself busy will not
        only help me improve my skills but also maintain high motivation.
      </p>

      <h3>My First Achievement</h3>
      <p>
        With great satisfaction, I can say that I've already completed my first challenge on <a
          href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. Although it was a simple challenge,
        it gave me a sense of accomplishment and motivated me to continue on this learning path. Every small step
        counts, and I'm eager to face more complex challenges in the future. <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/"
          target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a> is an excellent option for practicing and improving frontend skills, and
        it has many great free challenges to keep you busy and motivated for a good while. So far, my experience has
        been satisfactory, and I highly recommend their challenges for web developers with different skill levels, as
        the site has challenges for all levels of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a wide variety of useful frameworks in the
        frontend area.
      </p>

        You can follow my progress on my <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/bonzoycv"
          target="_blank">Frontend Mentor profile</a>. Additionally, I'll be uploading my solutions to my <a
          href="https://github.com/bonzoycv" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository, where you can see the code and my
        evolution in this Learning Path.
